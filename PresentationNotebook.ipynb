    "Our process for choosing the metric started with Mark wanting to get away with parking illegally. We could have looked at the best neighborhood for avoiding tickets, getting away with crime, or alternatively the worst neighborhoods for those things. Instead, we looked a little more broad and realized that free parking saves money, which can also be done by other things, and when we all graduate with plenty of student loans and are looking for our first jobs, we will need that.\n"
