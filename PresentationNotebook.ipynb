    "Our process for choosing the metric started with Mark wanting to get away with parking illegally. We could have looked at the best neighborhood for avoiding tickets, getting away with crime, or alternatively the worst neighborhoods for those things. Instead, we looked a little more broad and realized that free parking saves money, which can also be done by other things, and when we all graduate with plenty of student loans and are looking for our first jobs, we will need that.\n"

    "For this metric, I used the Contract Rent dataset from the 2015 Pittsburgh American Community Survey. This dataset inlcudes the number of houses/properties rented in each neighborhood under different price ranges. As most recent graduates are not in a position to buy a house, most will be looking to rent. Paying for housing often takes up the largest portion of ones income, so minimizing the cost of this will be very important to saving money. While this dataset is slightly old, and doesn't account for other costs such as utilities, it can give a good baseline for where each neighborhood sits relative to others in terms of cost. "
