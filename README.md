## Abstract : 
The best neighborhood in Pittsburgh to live in as a broke recent college graduate, which most of us will be in a few years, is Beechview. Beechview was the third best neighborhood for cheap housing, it has only 28% of the amount of crime in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh, and while it does have some parking meters, it was on the lower end of amoun

The overall metric used to determine the best neighborhood was the best neighborhood for a broke recent college graduate. As we will soon be the person, it seemed fitting to determine where would be the best place in Pittsburgh to live. There were three categories we used to determine the best neighborhood for someone looking to live for cheap: cheap housing (Emme's metric), free parking (Mark's metric), and safety (Owen's metric). Cheap housing is obviously ideal for someone looking to save money, as is free parking-- those are usually unavoidable and quite large costs for an adult, so minimizing them can help save a lot of money. Safety is also very important in looking to save money, because it minimizes the extra precautions one has to spend time and money on, as well as minimizes the risk of having to pay for damages to yourself or your property.
