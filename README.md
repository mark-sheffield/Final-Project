## Abstract : 
The overall metric was which neighborhood would be best for a broke recent college graduate to live in, as determined by cheap housing (Emme's metric), free parking (Mark's metric), and safety (Owen's metric). Cheap housing is obviously ideal for someone looking to save money, as is free parking-- those are usually unavoidable and quite large costs for an adult, so minimizing them can help save a lot of money. Safety is also very important in looking to save money, because it minimizes the extra precautions one has to spend time and money on, as well as minimizes the risk of having to pay for damages to yourself or your property. 

The best neighborhood in Pittsburgh to live in as a broke recent college graduate, which most of us will be in a few years, is Mt. Oliver. Though Mt. Oliver was not the best neighborhood for cheap housing, it has only the second lowest of the amount of crime (less than 1%) than the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh (Southside Flats), and it does not have any parking meters. The neighborhood was not the number one neighborhood in any of our individual metrics, but Mt. Oliver was the net highest neighborhood across the board, according to our metrics.
